# DynamicForm Component Documentation

## Overview
The `DynamicForm` component is a flexible and reusable form that dynamically generates input fields based on a schema fetched from an API. It supports various field types, including text, number, date, JSON, dropdowns, and color pickers.

## Props

| Prop Name       | Type         | Description |
|----------------|-------------|-------------|
| `open`         | `boolean`    | Controls whether the form is open or not. |
| `selectedStatus` | `string` (optional) | Pre-selected status value, used for status-related dropdowns. |
| `onClose`      | `() => void` | Callback function triggered when the form is closed. |
| `handleOnSubmit` | `(data: any) => void` | Function called when the form is submitted with the entered data. |
| `model`        | `string`     | Specifies the model name for API fetching and field generation. |

## Behavior
- Fetches field definitions from `/api/{model}?type=fields`.
- Populates dropdown fields based on fetched options.
- Automatically generates slugs for form entries if not provided.
- Submits form data to `/api/{model}` using a POST request.
- Displays a loading indicator (`GlobalLoader`) when fetching data or submitting.

## Field Handling
The component dynamically renders different types of input fields based on the schema:

### Skipped Fields
- `id` (Primary key)
- `createdAt` (Timestamp field)
- `slug` (Generated automatically)

### Supported Field Types
- **String Fields**: Rendered as text inputs.
- **Integer Fields**: Rendered as number inputs.
- **DateTime Fields**: Uses `DatePicker` from MUI.
- **JSON Fields**: Displays field name but lacks an interactive editor.
- **Dropdown Fields**: Fields ending in `Id` (e.g., `statusId`) are rendered as `<Select>` components with options fetched from the API.
- **Color Picker**: Uses `SketchPicker` from `react-color` for color selection.

## Example Usage
```tsx
<DynamicForm
  open={isOpen}
  model="task"
  selectedStatus="active"
  onClose={() => setIsOpen(false)}
  handleOnSubmit={(data) => console.log("Form Submitted", data)}
/>
```

## Customization
- Button position can be adjusted within the parent component.
- Additional field types can be supported by modifying the mapping logic.
- Styles can be customized via the `sx` prop in MUI components.

## Dependencies
- `@mui/material` (TextField, Select, MenuItem, DatePicker, FormControl, etc.)
- `react-hook-form` (Form handling)
- `react-color` (Color picker)
- `@mui/x-date-pickers` (Date selection)

## Notes
- Ensure the API provides a consistent schema for the form fields.
- Modify field handling logic if new data types need to be supported.
- Uses the `useLoading` hook to track loading state during data fetch and submission.

This component provides an easy way to create dynamic forms based on API responses, making it highly reusable across different models in your application. ðŸš€
